PyCD is a Python package for managing catalytic dynamics workflows, coupling ab initio molecular dynamics, density functional theory outputs, and energy analysis in a single toolkit. It streamlines trajectory handling, automated job submission, and data reduction so that large simulation campaigns can be explored efficiently.

The project emphasizes reproducible workflows, clear APIs, and integrations with workflow schedulers common in high-performance computing. PyCD also exposes data pipelines that make it easy to connect simulation results with downstream analytics or machine learning models.
