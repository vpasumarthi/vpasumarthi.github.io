CatEnergy provides a lightweight toolkit for parsing, aggregating, and visualizing reaction energetics from density functional theory and molecular dynamics studies. It offers a consistent interface for building reaction coordinate diagrams, comparing catalyst candidates, and exporting results for communication with collaborators.

The package is designed to plug into automated workflows, making it straightforward to track energy changes across large datasets and to share clear visuals that guide mechanistic decisions.
