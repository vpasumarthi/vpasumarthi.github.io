I am a computational scientist and postdoctoral research associate working at the intersection of chemistry, catalysis, and materials science. I use *ab initio* molecular dynamics, density functional theory, and multiscale modeling to understand surface reactions that matter for energy conversion and electrocatalysis. My work also includes building open source scientific software and automated workflows in Python that run on high performance computers. I enjoy taking ideas from first principles simulations to practical insight, and collaborating with both academic and industrial teams. I previously worked with the SUNCAT Center at SLAC and am currently based in Lafayette, Indiana, USA.
